  People, could somebody subscribing for "Electronic Gaming World" and other
similar magazines go through the "S.W.A.T." sections in them and write down
all GameBoy cheats/passwords/etc. not included into this file? I would
appreciate your help.

  Also, there is a lot of GameGenie codes posted recently in r.g.v.nintendo
and GB mailing list which are not listed in the official Galoob updates. Could
somebody compile these codes into a separate list?

  Another thing needed by me and many other people on the Net who requested it
is map for GB Metroid. If you have this map in some magazine or a strategy
guide, *PLEASE* scan it and send the .GIF [or whatever file you get] to me. If
you don't have a scanner, xerox it and send copy to me by snail-mail. My

********************* I. GameBoy: General Description ************************
 
    CPU:  8-bit Z80 work-alike at 4.194304MHz
    RAM:  8kB internal
    ROM:  256kBit, 512kBit, 1MBit, 2MBit and 4MBit cartridges are known
          (32kB, 64kB, 128kB, 256kB and 512kB). Probably, there are 16kB
          cartridges as well.
    VRAM: 8kB internal

    Sound: 4 channels each of which can be mapped either to the left
           or to the right or to both speakers
    
    Video: 
      Display: Reflective LCD 160x144 dots
      Colors:  4 shades of gray
      Sprites: 40 sprites of either 8x8 or 8x16 [switchable]

    Communications: Serial port
      Up to 4 Gameboys can be connected together using these ports
      
    Power: 6 Volts, 0.7 Watts 
      4 AA Batteries             - 35 hours
                       OR
      Rechargable battery (NAKI) - 12 hours
           
* What are the advantages of GB in comparison with other portable videogames?

  The same reflective LCD screen which is considered to be the weak point of
GameBoy, is its advantage. Other systems, such as Atari Lynx or SEGA GameGear,
use backlighted color screens which consume several times more power than
reflective LCD of GB. Thus, these systems need 6 AA batteries instead of 4 AAs
needed by GB and drain these batteries in about 6 hours. Also, dots on GB's
LCD are much smaller than dots on the color screens of other portables which
[given that you have a good light source nearby] means that GB's LCD looks
crisper. The other advantage of GameBoy is that it is the only portable
videogame you can actually PUT INTO YOUR POCKET. Both Lynx and GameGear are
too big for it. Speaking about variety of games available for GB, I would
*NOT* consider it an advantage of GB if we are talking solely about its
technical characteristics. Amount of software written for the system has
nothing to do with the system's hardware architecture. It is rather determined
by commercial success of the system and, in fact, by how it is marketed. There
are many technologically superior systems which just didn't make it because of
the poor marketing [TurboGrafx is an example].

9. Cheats in Final Fantasy Legend II:

On some stage of the game double-clicking on the Trashcan [or, maybe, trying
to "move" Trashcan to the different position in the list] will allow to
increase Agility or Strength of the party members. This trick appeared only
once and I couldn't repeat it. I also got responses from two people who
encountered similar effect. Everybody who has more info on this trick, send
email to me.

Here is some mail I got:
"I clicked twice on the trashcan, then the list showing my 4 players was
shown. I clicked on one of them and his strength and agility was increased.
After increasing my other players strength many times with this method, an
error, or glith occured, for my pieces of mana went haywire. When I would
use the trashcan method, the number of mana pieces would go down. And when I
used the compass to locate the pieces, it would give me some bizarre number.
If I can remember, I had about 53-57 pieces collected before I began
increasing my player's status. Also, I had to start a new game after that
because the game wouldn't register that I had any mana, and I couldn't go
anywhere in the pillar of sky." -- JSem33@aol.com

Another interesting cheat known as "Dragon Ride":
  In the race world, with mutants in your party, your can ride the dragon
off the track and around the world. Simply fight the boss ones with screen
icons on the track (the ones with the magi) until a mutant gets teleport.
Save before you fight the monsters; that way, if you don't get teleport, you
can just press all four buttons to reset the game and try again. Use this
skill while on the dragon. You can then ride around the world quickly, and
move through walls. You can go all the way to the end of the game and get cool
weapons by going through celestial doors backwards, and then zooming around to
a higher level exit. The dragon will occasionally be lost during story
sections of the game, but can always be retreived by starting a race again.
NEVER CROSS THE FINISH LINE!!!

32. Passwords for Prince of Persia:

  A password is an 8-digit number abcdefgh. The first 3 digits (abc) are
check-digits, the next one (d) codes the number of lives, the next two (ef)
code the minutes left and the last two (gh) designate the level. How to
construct your own password:

1. Choose your level and jot it down as two digits and reverse.
   Example: choose level 8 and write down 80.
2. Choose the number of minutes left and write it down in two digits,
   reverse, and append it to the left of the level.
   Example: choose 59 minutes, which gives 9580.
3. Choose the number of lifes (1 digit) and append it to the left.
   Example: choose 7 lifes to obtain 79580.
4. Call the result DEFGH and construct ABC as follows:
     C = G + H (subtract 10 if necessary)
     B = E + F (subtract 10 if necessary)
     A = C + D (subtract 10 if necessary)
   This way the 8-digit number ABCDEFGH is obtained.
   Example: C = 8 + 0 = 8
            B = 9 + 5 = 4
            A = 8 + 7 = 5
            The result is 54879580.
5. Generate abcdefgh from ABCDEFGH by substituting each digit
   according to the table at the bottom. In our example 54879580
   becomes the password 01928095 which is good for 7 lifes and 59
   minutes on level 8.
   Table: FROM  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
          INTO  5  4  7  6  1  0  3  2  9  8

2-1: 532773    3-1: 355530    4-1: 524358    5-1: 650594
2-2: 753442    3-2: 526158    4-2: 780554    5-2: 105960
2-3: 362459    3-3: 085530    4-3: 546127    5-3: 155965

Final:   968158
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. Warioland cheat:

  Pause the game, then hit select 16 times. A box should appear over lives,
time, or coins. Using A and B buttons you can increase all three to their
maximum. This is available on each level.

************************* IV. List of the best games *************************

  This list is compiled based on the ratings and reviews I got from various
sources. The fact that some game is in the list doesn't necessarily mean that
it is the best game for you; it just means that this game is worth checking
out. I put asterisk (*) next to my personal favorites. For the current
information about the best games, you can refer to the "Nick's GameBoy Game

******************************* V. Game Genie ********************************

1. How it works?

  GameGenie allows you to substitute some of the codes in the cartridge ROM
with your own codes. For example, you can substitute the default number of
lives with your own number. GameBoy GameGenie allows to substitute up to three
codes.

2. Where to get the codes?

  GameBoy GameGenie codes are available through anonymous FTP at
  
       ftp.netcom.com     directory  /pub/vidgames/gamegenie

3. What is the meaning of the digits in GameGenie code for GameBoy?

  * All digits are in hexadecimal system

         GameBoy GameGenie Code:     DD2-103-???
         
         DD         - Data Byte
         0,1,2,3    - Address, reads as 3210     
         ???        - Meaning of these digits is unknown.
                      It is suspected that they represent the
                      ROM paging register, but no information
                      is available.
         
   Example: 3D2-ABF-3BE - Set 3Dh (DEC A command) at address F2ABh 
           
4. Some commonly used Z80 instructions with their codes:

  Code(s):  Instruction:       Common Usage:   
   3Eh xxh  - LD A,xxh    Load default number of lives (energy,ammo,etc.)
   3Dh      - DEC A       Decrease number of lives (energy,ammo,etc.)
   3Ch      - INC A       Increase number of lives (energy,ammo,etc.)
   00h      - NOP         DO NOTHING (set this instead of 3Dh)

5. CodeMasters' address and phone number:

   Codemasters
   Lower Farm House,              PHONE: +44 926 814132
   Southam,
   Warwickshire.
   CV33 0DL
   UK

  * I didn't try calling them. If you get any additional information from
    CodeMasters, please, email it to me

6. Hidden messages in GameGenie:

   1. UDLR             2. BALR[SELECT]     3. UUABADD
   4. RUDULUDU         5. BABRLDU          6. AAAABBB[START]
   7. RLRLDDUU         8. ABABAA[SELECT]   9. ALLABRRB

7. Why some GameGenie codes don't work?

  Some games exist in several different versions. Although these versions look
exactly the same, the actual program codes differ. Therefore, while some
GameGenie codes work with one version of the cartridge, they aren't guaranteed
to work with other versions.


**************************** VI. Various Questions ***************************

1. Are there any GameBoy emulators for the personal computers?
  
  YES, there is a GameBoy emulator written by me, Marat Fayzullin. It is
called Virtual GameBoy and can be obtained from

  http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/fms/MSX/VGB.html

  The Virtual GameBoy is portable. Its distribution includes C source code
which can be compiled on any computer [given that there are system-dependent
drivers for this computer] and a set of sample drivers for Unix/XWindows. For
more information, refer to documentation at above-mentioned WWW.
  There is also a GameBoy-look-alike emulator for the Commodore Amiga called
ToyBoy. This emulator can be obtained via FTP from AmiNet sites:
  
  ftp.luth.se:           /pub/aminet/misc/emu/Gameboy68000.lha
  ftp.etsu.edu:          /aminet/misc/emu/GameBoy68000.lha
  wuarchive.wustl.edu:   /systems/amiga/aminet/misc/emu/Gameboy68000.lha
  
  Unfortunately, this package is incomplete amd HAS NOTHING TO DO with the
real GameBoy. It was stolen from a UK-based company called Argonaut which does
hardware and software development for Nintendo. According to Argonaut's
managing director Jez San, ToyBoy was an in-house emulator written to see how
difficult it would be to program GameBoy games. Since its authors knew nothing
about internals of the real GameBoy when they were writing the emulator,
ToyBoy is completely incompatible with GameBoy.
  
2. Is it possible to build a backlight into GameBoy?

  A Japanese company sells a kit to add the EL-backlight to GameBoy. The kit
costs 5000yen.
(Information provided by Cinnichiro Ichise [ichise@mica.semicon.sony.co.jp])

3. Are there any game copiers for GameBoy?

  There is a SmartCard copier allowing to download data from GameBoy cards to
PC via parallel port and store up to 4 games in a 4MBit flash-RAM cartridge.
  There are said to be GameBoy adaptors for MultiGameDoctorII,
MultiGameHunter, SuperWildCard, and SuperComPro.
  Also, there is a device allowing to play games stored on credit card-like
magnetic cards which is produced in Japan and isn't sold in U.S.

4. MultiGame cartridges for GameBoy:

  Yes, these cartridges are at least half-illegal because their producers
violate copyright law. Yes, these things exist for GameBoy.
  At present time, there are four kinds of them: 48in1, 64in1, 86in1 and
105in1 (although there were rumors about 200in1 and even 1500in1 cartridges.
The latter is said to be 15-20 cm long). They all seem to contain the same
basic set of games most of which are either old Nintendo products (like
Alleyway or Tennis) or low-quality games from other companies with a couple of
good games added. Number of games in such a cartridge is actually SMALLER than
the number written on the box because some games are present in two or three
copies (with a number of lives and other things changed). For example, 64in1
cartridge contains only about 48 DISTINCT games. At least 27 of them can be
classified as "logic" or "strategy" games.
  There were many requests to list games multigame cartridges contain. So,
here is a list of games how it appears in a menu of a 105in1 cartridge. Other
multigame cartridges contain subset of games listed below. Notice the large
number of japanese titles and repetitions. There are also some titles which
actually correspond to the same game.

5. Using GameGenie with multigame cartridges:

  No, GameGenie DOES NOT WORK with multigame cartridges.  

6. GameBoy clones:

  There seem to be several GameBoy clones produced in Asia. Two of them are
called Sunny and WonderBoy. The only difference is the name printed on the
case. This information was supplied by Simon Lai.
  The Russian GameBoy clone is called Bitman2000, if it is a clone and not a
real GameBoy distributed in Russia under that name.

7. Japanese cartridges:

  These are cartridges which are not available in U.S., although you can find
them if you are lucky. Following descriptions of japanese cartridges were
prepared by Mark Kaufman.

* Name: Parodius                     Type: Shooter     Producer: Konami  
  Graphics: 10       Sound: 10       Playability: 10   Overall: 10

  This is the legendary Japanese shooter to which all others are compared.
  It is awesome, huge, creative, challenging and fun, fun, fun.

* Name: Twinbee                      Type: Shooter     Producer: Konami
  Graphics:  9       Sound:  9       Playability:  9   Overall:  9

  Another Japanese cart that should be sold over here.  It's better than
  90% of all GB games.

8. Where to get parts to repair GameBoy?

  Mark Kaufman found address of the company selling replacement parts for
GameBoy [as well as Sega AC adapters and Atari parts]. Here is their phone
number and a list of GameBoy parts they carry:

9. Some time ago, there was a preview of a 3D vectored game for GB 
   called "Lunar Chase" in Nintendo Power magazine. What happened with
   this game?

  According to Nintendo, the game was cancelled :(. This information was
obtained from Nintendo hotline [1-800-255-3700 in USA].


********************** VII. Programming, Hardware, etc. *********************

  Information about GameBoy hardware is extremely hard to find. Most of it
is incomplete, uncertain and vague. If you have any information [especially
about things listed in "Unanswered Questions" section], PLEASE, email it to
fms@wam.umd.edu. The following information is mostly based on a document by
Dr.Pan of Anthrox, but also includes some results of research done by Peter
Knight and myself.

1. Development tools for GameBoy:

  There are very few publically accessible development tools available for 
GB. Some of them are:

  * SmartCard copier allows to download the code from GB cartridges into
    PC and store up to 4 cartridges in a special 512kB flash-ROM card.
  * Logical analyzers allowing to trace various signals in GB circuitry
    are also very useful for hacking.
  * SNES Magic Disassembler by Dr.Pan is written primarily for SNES, but
    it also allows to disassemble, explore, and change GB code. SMD is
    a shareware and it runs on Amiga.
  * Another GB disassembler for PC is written by HeroZero.
  * Virtual GameBoy emulator by me is a portable emulator written in C.
    The distribution version runs on Unix/X systems, but with proper
    drivers VGB can run on just about anything, given that your machine
    is fast enough. VGB also includes a small disassembler for GB code.

2. GameBoy cartridge pinouts [not complete]:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pin    Function
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1      Vcc [+5V]
  2      ? Connected on Gameboy, but not used on GamePaks.
  3      /RESET
  4      /WR
  5      ? Used by paging PAL on high capacity GamePaks.

  30     /RD
  31     ? Connected on Gameboy, but not used on Game-Paks.
  32     GND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. GameBoy CPU:

  As it appears, the CPU used in GameBoy is not exactly Z80. Some of Z80
instructions and registers are missing while others are added:

* The "shadow" set of registers [BC',DE',HL',AF'] and the index registers
  [IX,IY] are missing and, consequently, there are no DD and FD opcode tables.

* I/O ports are gone and so are all IN/OUT opcodes.

* HALT is interrupted even when interrupts are disabled.

* Following Z80 opcodes are changed:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code       Z80 operation  GameBoy operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. GameBoy memory map:
--------------------------- FFFF  | 32kB ROMs are non-switchable and occupy
 I/O ports + internal RAM         | 0000-7FFF are. Bigger ROMs use one of two

                                  | 4000-7FFF. RAM switching is not provided.

5. Internal information area:

  The internal information area is located at 0100-014F in each cartridge. It
contains following values:

0100-0103  A sequence of bytes 00 C3 xx xx where last two bytes contain the
           starting address of a cartridge [lower byte first]. The first two
           bytes of this sequence can be used as a "magic number" to
           recognize GameBoy cartridges. When GameBoy starts, the control is
           passed to address 0100 and then the sequence is interpreted as
           NOP; JP <addr>.
0105-0133  Nintendo character area:

           a cartridge except for two checksum bytes together and taking
           two lower bytes of the result.

6. Video controller:

  Main GameBoy screen buffer [aka background] consists of 256x256 pixels or
32x32 tiles [8x8 pixels each]. Only 160x144 pixels can be displayed on the
screen. Registers SCROLLX and SCROLLY hold the coordinates of background to be
displayed in the left upper corner of the screen. Background wraps around the
screen i.e. when part of it goes off the screen, it appears on the opposite
side.
  An area of VRAM known as Background Tile Table contains the numbers of tiles
to be displayed. It is organized as 32 rows of 32 bytes each. Each byte
contains a number of a tile to be displayed. Tile patterns are taken from the
Tile Pattern Table located either at 8000-8FFF or 8800-97FF. In the first
case, patterns are numbered with unsigned numbers from 0 to 255 [i.e. pattern
#0 lies at address 8000]. In the second case, patterns have signed numbers
from -128 to 127 [i.e. pattern #0 lies at address 9000]. The Tile Pattern
Table address for the background can be selected via LCDCONT register.
  Besides background, there is also a "window" overlaying the background. The
window is not scrollable i.e. it is always displayed starting from its left
upper corner. The location of a window on the screen can be adjusted via
WNDPOSX and WNDPOSY registers. Screen coordinates of the top left corner of a
window are WNDPOSX-7,WNDPOSY. The tile numbers for the window are stored in
the Window Tile Table in the same way as background tiles are stored in the
Background Tile Table. The tile patterns are taken from the table at 
8800-97FF and therefore have unsigned numbers.
  Both background and window can be disabled or enabled separately via bits
in the LCDCONT register. There is also a special bit allowing to make window
"transparent". When window is transparent, pixels of color #0 are not being
displayed.

  The tile images are stored in the Tile Pattern Tables. Each 8x8 image
occupies 16 bytes, where each 2 bytes represent a line:

  Tile:                                              Image:

  As it was said before, there are two Tile Pattern Tables at 8000-8FFF and at
8800-97FF. The first one can be used for sprites and the background. Its tiles
are numbered from 0 to 255. The second table can be used for the background
and the window display and its tiles are numbered from -128 to 127.
  GameBoy video controller can also display up to 40 sprites either in 8x8 or
in 8x16 mode. Sprite patterns have the same format as tiles, but they are
taken from the Sprite Pattern Table located at 8000-8FFF and therefore have
unsigned numbers. Sprite attributes reside in the Sprite Attribute Table [aka
OAM] at FE00-FE9F. OAM is divided into 40 4-byte blocks each of which
corresponds to a sprite. Blocks have the following format:

  Byte0  Y position on the screen
  Byte1  X position on the screen
  Byte2  Pattern number 0-255 [notice that unlike tile numbers, sprite
         pattern numbers are unsigned] 
  Byte3  Flags:
         Bit7  Priority
               Sprite is displayed in front of the window if this bit
               is set to 1. Otherwise, sprite is shown behind the
               window but in front of the background.
         Bit6  Y flip
               Sprite pattern is flipped vertically if this bit is
               set to 1.
         Bit5  X flip
               Sprite pattern is flipped horizontally if this bit is
               set to 1.
         Bit4  Palette number
               Sprite colors are taken from OBJ1PAL if this bit is
               set to 1 and from OBJ0PAL otherwise.

7. GameBoy Sound:

  There are two sound channels connected to the output terminals SO1 and SO2.
There is also a input terminal Vin connected to the cartridge. It can be
routed to either of both output terminals. GameBoy circuitry allows produces
sound in four different ways:

  1. Quadrangular wave patterns with sweep and envelope functions
  2. Quadrangular wave patterns with envelope functions
  3. Voluntary wave pattern
  4. White noise

  These four sounds can be controlled independantly and then mixed separately
for each of the output terminals.

8. GameBoy I/O ports:

  I/O ports are mapped to memory locations in FF00-FFFF area:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FF00 -- JOYPAD [RW] Joypad port
      Bit5   Bit4    | In order to scan the keys, output 0 into either Bit4
Bit3  DOWN   START   | or Bit5 of JOYPAD, wait for some time and read JOYPAD.
Bit2  UP     SELECT  | Bits 0-3 will be set to zeroes if corresponding
Bit1  LEFT   B       | buttons are pressed. Bits 6 and 7 are not used. Bits
Bit0  RIGHT  A       | 0-3 are connected to input lines P10-P13. Bits 4 and 5
                     | are connected to ouput lines P14 and P15.

        Example:
        ; Routine finding which buttons were pressed since the last check
        LD A,20h     ; Set 0 at the output line P14
        LD (FF00h),A ; 
        LD A,(FF00h) ; Read JOYPAD several times to accomodate the noise
        LD A,(FF00h) ;
        CPL          ; Bits 0-3 are now 1s if corresponding buttons pressed
        AND 0Fh      ; Extract lower 4 bits carrying button status...
        SWAP A       ; ...and move them into upper for bits
        LD B,A       ; At this point: B = START.SELECT.B.A.x.x.x.x
        LD A,10h     ; Set 0 at the output line P15
        LD (FF00h),A ;
        LD A,(FF00h) ; Read JOYPAD several times to accomodate the noise
        LD A,(FF00h) ;
        LD A,(FF00h) ;
        LD A,(FF00h) ;
        LD A,(FF00h) ;
        LD A,(FF00h) ;
        CPL          ; Bits 0-3 are now 1s if corresponding buttons pressed
        AND 0Fh      ; Extract lower 4 bits carrying buttons' status...
        OR B         ; ...and combine them with 4 other button status bits
        LD D,A       ; At this point: D = START.SELECT.B.A.DOWN.UP.LEFT.RIGHT
        LD A,(FF8Bh) ; Read old button status from RAM
        XOR D        ; Set 1s for buttons whose status has changed
        AND D        ; Extract buttons which were *pressed* since last check
        LD (FF8Ch),A ; Save information of those buttons
        LD A,D       ; Update button status in RAM
        LD (FF8Bh),A ;
        LD A,30h     ; Set 1s at both P14 and P15 lines
        LD (FF00h),A ; [probably to reset the circuitry]

        of the left upper corner of a window on the screen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FF4B -- WNDPOSX [RW] Window X Position
        WNDPOSX may assume values 7-166. It determines the horizontal position

        is WNDPOSX-7.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FF46 -- DMACONT [W] DMA Transfer Control
        Writing to this register will cause a DMA transfer into OAM located
        at FE00-FE9F. The written value determines the source address in a
        following way: 00 -> 0000, 01 -> 0100, ... , 9A -> 9A00, ...
        The DMA transfer takes about 160 nanoseconds.

        Example:
        ; Routine transferring 0400-049F into OAM
        DI           ; Disable interrupts
        LD A,04h     ; Transferring data from 0400h 
        LD (FF46h),A ; Start DMA transfer
  LOOP: LD A,#40     ; Wait
        DEC A        ;
        JR NZ,LOOP   ;
        EI           ; Enable interrupts

* Reviews: Please, send your reviews of GB games. Rate four categories:

                Graphics   Sound   Playability   Overall

  Give ratings from 0 to 9 for each of these categories. Also, classify the
game [RPG, shoot-em-up, classic, etc.] and give information about the
cartridge size and manufacturer. Games which get more than 2 ratings from
different people, will be mentioned in the FAQ. I still couldn't collect
enough of these raitings to come to any conclusions.
